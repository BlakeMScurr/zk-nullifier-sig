# PLUME: Verifiably Deterministic Signatures on ECDSA

This allows for the construction of deterministic nullifiers. We intend to deploy it as Privately Linked Unique Message Entities (PLUME).

## Implementations

- `rust-k256`: Rust, using the k256 library
- `rust-arkworks`: Rust, using arkworks
- `javascript`: JavaScript, using MIRACL

## Testing the circom circuit

First, clone this repository and navigate to the `javascript/` directory.

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

Then, navigate to the `circuits/` directory and install the dependencies there:

```bash
npm i
```

Run the tests:
```bash
npm run flatten-deps && \
npm run test
```

Be prepared to wait around 20-40 minutes for the tests to complete.

## TODO

- Incorporate the [V2 proposed by poseidon](https://www.notion.so/PLUME-Discussion-6f4b7e7cf63e4e33976f6e697bf349ff) to be a codepath both in the wallet [WIP PR](https://github.com/zk-nullifier-sig/zk-nullifier-sig/pull/9) and in the circom (task still open)
- improve `rust-k256` to use a similar interface as `rust-arkworks` - i.e. generate/accept arbitrary keypairs and `r` values, and not just hardcoded values
- rewrite in halo2 (WIP by blakemscurr and vuvoth, dm to contribute via a grant!)
- reduce number of arguments to c via Wei Dai's + [Poseidons](https://www.notion.so/mantanetwork/PLUME-Discussion-6f4b7e7cf63e4e33976f6e697bf349ff?pvs=4) suggestions
- Edit: Poseidon will be too slow in Ledger and is a newer hash function -- given that we have reasonably efficient sha256 hashing with [zkevm sha256](https://github.com/Brechtpd/zkevm-circuits/tree/sha256), we do not intend to switch the hash function

### Circom Proofs
See [this PR](https://github.com/zk-nullifier-sig/zk-nullifier-sig/pull/7).   
6.5 million constraints. Mostly dominated by EC operations, but the hashes are very expensive too.  

sha256 ~1.5M. 
hash_to_curve ~0.5M. 
a/b^c ~1.5 each (this is the sub circuit for the first 2 verification equations). 
the remaining 1.5M is probably dominated by calculating g^s and h^s.
